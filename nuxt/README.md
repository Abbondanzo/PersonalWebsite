# abbondanzo

This site is built using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Once upon a time, many years ago, I started this project and I will continue to maintain it until the day JavaScript is outlawed. Hence, it's always in progress even when my last commit was 12+ months ago. There's not much else to add besides head on over to https://abbondanzo.com and check it out.

## Env Information

Inside this folder, there is an `.env.example` file. This must be _copied_ and named as `.env` with your correct Google Analytics tracking IDs. Even if you have no IDs, you should still perform this test or Webpack will fail to build.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
