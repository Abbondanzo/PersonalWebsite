        Bonne Vie Café began as a mockup design made for a college student. He
        had very little requirements, other than to satisfy a number of
        sections. When he came to me, I knew just how to build the perfect site.

      <img
        alt="Stylesheet and index side-by-side"
        src="~/assets/img/bonne/b1.jpg"
      />
      <span>Stylesheet and index side-by-side</span>
      <p>
        I started by designing a wireframe and various slides in Adobe Photoshop
        and InDesign. The customer instantly fell in love and we went from
        there. I built the site from scratch using various amounts of PHP and
        Javascript to handle contact/review forms and table reservations.
        Everything else was made using HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <img
        alt="Preview of the download section"
        src="~/assets/img/bonne/b2.jpg"
      />
      <img
        alt="Preview of the reservation section"
        style="padding: 40px 0"
        src="~/assets/img/bonne/b3.jpg"
      />
      <p>
        Users can book a reservation in just a few clicks. I utilized Zapla's
        table management API to allow potential restaurant-goers to see what
        number of tables are available. Users could also view a number of
        informative canvases that displayed restaurant location and contact
        details.
