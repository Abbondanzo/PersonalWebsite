        If you're like most people and
        <i>haven't</i> heard of the game Rocket League, let me give you the
        short version: <b>soccer, but with cars</b>. It's a little more nuanced
        than that; there is a massive distribution of players of all skill
        levels who have mastered the game's mechanics. Twice a year, hundreds of
        thousands of people gather to

      />
      <span>Yes, they built an arena</span>

      <p>
        Needless to say, there's a huge interest in this game. Like a modern
        first-person shooter or generic sports game, Rocket League is heavily
        dependent on teamwork. Teams of 2 or 3 rely on their teammates to
        communicate, rotate, pass, and work together to win. Hence, large
        communities have spawned as a result. Everything from national
        Collegiate Rocket League tournaments to local brackets where players
        like myself can compete.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of these local communities went by the name of
        <a href="https://www.rlbot.org/" target="_blank" class="under">RLBot</a
        >, a few programming enthusiasts who wanted to see if they could write
        bot players who could compete with one another, using these same
        mechanical skills and tactics that real players exercised. The RLBot
        team gained a following, receiving shoutouts from large content creators
        who played the game.

      <p>
        I was curious about building my own bot so I joined up and began poking
        around what other creators had built. One bot went by the name of
        <a
          class="under"
          href="https://github.com/SaltieRL/Saltie"
          target="_blank"
          >Saltie</a
        >, a deep reinforcement learning bot training on replays that the
        creators fed to it. Little did I know,

          >one of the creators</a

        went to the same university I did, Northeastern, so I had to meet up.
      </p>
      <p>
        He introduced me to the whole project and how the biggest difficulty
        they were facing was that they couldn't simulate enough games fast
        enough to produce a viable bot. So instead they launched
        <a class="under" href="https://calculated.gg/" target="_blank"
          >calculated.gg</a
        >, a website primarily aimed at collecting user-submitted replays from
        the game and performing analysis to discover what tactics and actions
        that top-tier players performed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calculated houses a wide number of statistics, predictions, and player
        analysis. At nearly 2.5 million replays to date, they are unmatched by
        any other community. They include information about your overall
        playstyles and how you perform individual matches. But I digress; let
        the site speak for itself.

      <p>
        I had very little game developer experience prior to this project, much
        less with Three.js. I initially began work on this project during a
        12-hour hackathon with a few other members at a laboratory tucked away
        in a corner of Northeastern's library. We were able to get a very rough
        prototype displaying some crudely-designed cars, an object that
        represented the ball, and a basic field and set of goals.
      </p>

      <span>A very early version of the replay viewer</span>
      <p>
        Since the site was early in development at this time, we spent more of
        our efforts on the backend side of things, getting a viable set of data
        to return to the frontend for parsing. I worked on two important systems
        during this time: an FPS Clock that allowed forward and reverse
        scrolling over frame data and an animation interpolation system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The quick version about 3D animation in Three.js is that animations are
        made up of keyframes composited into a clip, linked together by a mixer,
        and run by an action. Each frame contains relevant information about
        every parameter of every object in the scene, including position and
        rotation&mdash;the two most important pieces of information in a replay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most 3D design software lets you easily build these animations and
        export them into a system like Three's for consumption. But that was not
        the case for us, since we parsed replay data from the game into JSON and
        then had to animate it manually ourselves.
      </p>
      <img
        alt="Example of keyframes that are interpolated"
        src="~/assets/img/replay-viewer/rv8.png"
      />
      <span
        >Each of those little diamonds are keyframes and software like this
        (blender) interpolates it for you</span
      >
      <p>
        The second piece of the equation was a global clock for tracking time.
        There's another issue with rolling data from one game engine into
        another: how do you represent time? In replay files from Rocket League,
        each frame of the game contained a plethora of information about each
        player's location, rotation, and state (like boosting or demolished).
        This frame also contains a delta, which is the amount of time that this
        frame existed for before transitioning to the next frame.
      </p>
      <p>
        A delta is often a very small measure of time, something like
        0.03605506s or 0.03618125s. As you may have noticed, these are not even
        fractions of time. We cannot rely on iterating over each frame on a
        fixed interval since the end result is a choppy mess that speeds up and
        slows down noticeably. Or if we missed a few frames and the delta is a
        large number, the animation would skip haphazardly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, the browser keeps track of the time since the user loaded the
        page down to the nanosecond with a function called `performance.now()`.
        Since we have one global game state, our one global clock can keep track
        of an "elapsed time" or the amount of time that has progressed in the
        replay animation. Given these deltas from each frame, we can convert
        them to represent an elapsed time by simply adding them up.
      </p>

          by Peter Abbondanzo (
          <a href="https://codepen.io/abbondanzo">@abbondanzo</a>) on
          <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.

      </p>
      <span style="margin-top: -48px"
        >Run an example of converting deltas to elapsed frames</span
      >

      <p>
        But this is just the easy part. The issue is that we have to convert
        between the browser time and the "elapsed frame" time, including
        differences, when telling the state to update. This means that in order
        to support pausing/playing and reverse scrubbing behavior, we have to
        keep track of our own delta. A delta of deltas if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
        When playing the game, we can just set the delta of deltas, the "last
        delta", to the current browser time with a call to
        <code>performance.now()</code>. Each time we fire a frame update using
        the browser's built-in <code>setInterval</code> function, the
        subscribers of a frame update call to the clock's
        <code>getDelta</code> function. This returns the difference between the
        last delta and the current time, computes if we have elapsed any more
        frames, and sets the "last delta" to that current time.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's one last piece of the puzzle: setting a frame. In order to do
        this, we have to have a notion of what the current frame is and the
        difference of time between that current frame and the frame we want to
        go to. We use this difference and push it onto a "delta queue". Since
        the browser is still animating during this time, we want to ensure that
        setting frames does not interfere with the computation between last
        frame and next frame. The queue is used to combine all operations that
        might have occurred between the last frame and the next frame and
        applies them at once. It reduces the overhead of recomputing if we
        rapidly change the frame and ensures that there are no side effects when
        playing or pausing the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        That was certainly a mouthful, but if you'd like to get a closer look as
        to how this clock operates, check out

      <p>
        Some time elasped between the hackathon and the next time the project
        was picked up (for classes) but I picked it back up in the Spring of
        2019. The goal was get the project into a presentable state, which meant
        using better models and controls that actually warranted getting added
        to the Calculated.gg website.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was able to extract models from the game, including the ball, the
        field, and the most popular car in the game: the Octane. With the help
        of the community, we cleaned up the materials for these objects. The
        field and vehicles started to take shape. We began customizing them,
        mostly to optimize for web performance, but adding our own Calculated.gg
        flavor.
      </p>
      <ImageSlider auto-scroll="true" :delay="2000" :images="imageArray" />
      <span>Extracted model assets</span>

      <p>
        Performance wasn't amazing, so it warranted writing the most optimized
        set of managers I could come up with. I threw together a step-by-step
        loading system that lazily loaded assets (since there were over 26MB of
        them!), constructed the scene, configured the sizes of the objects, and
        initialized a handful of managers which each claimed their own
        responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the pieces as pluggable as possible, I moved everything to an
        event bus that dispatched and subscribed various managers with events
        that contained updates to cameras, game time progression, user
        interaction, and more. This optimization made the viewer performant
        enough to open for beta testing and we've had great success with
        testers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We announced the viewer just in time for RLCS Season 7, showing it off
        to a number of professional players and game casters who were all
        excited to use it. By moving the viewer to its own NPM package, we can
        move quicker with updates and changes without being locked down by the
        rest of the constantly changing calculated.gg website. You can view the
        NPM package below.
