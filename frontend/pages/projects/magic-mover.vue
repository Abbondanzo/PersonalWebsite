        AR technologies have been rapidly evolving only recently, and therefore
        have not been applied yet to the medical fields as much as VR has.
        However, AR seems to be promising in particular for home-based rehab
        because, unlike VR, AR overlaps virtual images onto the real world
        environments during simulation, thus possibly limiting the discomfort in
        patients. Recent evolutions of AR, like Hololens and Magic Leap One, by
        tracking the environmental structure where they are in, allow to
        literally place virtual objects in specific 3D positions, thus opening
        interesting perspectives for novel iteractive forms of rehabilitation.

        During MIT's Reality Virtually hackathon, we had chosen to investigate
        how AR could help in the most impactful way. We discovered that AR had
        <a class="under" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5567156"
          >a place in post-stroke treatments</a
        >, helping and empowering patients to exercise their motor skills and
        fully recover. In particular, this become important in the later stages
        of the rehab process or when patients no longer need hospital
        treatments, since they may want to work on their skills at home to get
        back to normal mobility and function.
      </p>

      <h2>What it does</h2>
      <p>
        We decided to build an AR game involving interacting with (i.e. moving
        and stacking) virtual objects. The user would move/stack them by looking
        at the object and placing it on a virtual mat (both of them anchored in
        the real space). Over time, the levels will get harder, requiring the
        user to move around the real space with increasing the complexity and
        magnitude of movements.

      <p>
        The project has been developed with Unity 3D and targeted to Microsoft
        Hololens. The interface is simple: to limit initially required mobility,
        all the user has to do is look at an object. Each object they look at
        glows and when they look long enough, a timer displays. When this timer
        is full, the virtual object is picked up and it is displayed in front of
        the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the user can move it onto the mat, which would also bring up a
        timer and at the end of the timer, drop the object where you put it (the
        timer would allow positioning). We programmed each of these actions in
        Unity, and used the Unity Spacial Mapping Toolkit to randomly generate
        objects in the desired section of the room.

        Working with the Hololens was a challenge because in the present version
        it is not possible to integrate or track hand movement in a way that
        wouldn't be too difficult for the patient (some of us even had trouble
        doing the pinching motion required for the Hololens). We adapted our
        project to moving things visually, which instead requires our patients
        to walk around more and get used to their houses again.
      </p>

      <h2>What's next for Magic Mover</h2>
      <p>
        From a purely technical point of view, we hope to integrate the Leap
        Motion controller or the Magic Leap to include hand tracking among the
        several forms of possible input. This will allow a more natural
        interaction with virtual objects, easing the picking up virtual objects
        in the earlier levels, and better grasping and moving them in advanced
        ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also hope to develop more levels to require more movement around the
        room, more challenging stacking patterns, and even bimanual activities,
        pronosupination and fine movement.

        We built this project in span of a single weekend but we made it open to
        everyone if they want to try it out or make their own version. You can
        check out the project below for an even more in-depth description of
        what it can do, including a small demo of the full game.
