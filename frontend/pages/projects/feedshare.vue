        FeedShare began as a collaborative project between two other
        Northeastern students and myself. My responsibility was to design a new
        interface and implement said interface as an application built with
        React Native.

      <img
        alt="Detail view, home view, and new item view respectively. Taken directly
        from the app"
        src="@/assets/img/feedshare/f1.png"
      />
      <span
        >Detail view, home view, and new item view respectively. Taken directly
        from the app</span
      >
      <p>
        The project is ongoing and under continuous development. These
        screenshots are all from my new design as part of Feedshare 2.0.
        Everything you see here is being tweaked and fine-tuned inside the
        application build. The beta version leading up to Feedshare 2.0 is
        functional and features much of the design displayed here. Since the new
        version has not been released publically, these views only exist here.

      <img
        alt="Login page prototype on Android device"
        src="@/assets/img/feedshare/f2.png"
      />
      <span>Login page prototype on Android device</span>
      <p>
        Every design element of the application was met with heavy testing and
        as a result, showcases the best of what we created. Every view was built
        as a wireframe, then brought into Photoshop for color tweaking.
        Eventually, I built a protoyped version; first in InVision, then in
        Sketch. From there, the design was implemented using a mixture of React
        Native, Swift, and Java.
