        Flipster came to be when I was contacted by a client out in Australia,
        Nihkil, looking to innovate the trading market. I was tasked with
        creating page-by-page mockups from the landing screen to the
        confirmation of a trade.

        His idea was a cross between Craigslist and eBay, where users could
        select to negotiate trades via the online interface and then meet in
        person to exchange. Users maintained rankings through their reputation,
        and all sales and purchases were handled by a proximity search.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to design the concepts, I utilized Adobeâ€™s Photoshop and
        Illustrator to deliver what Nihkil was looking for. Photoshop allowed me
        to make small tweaks without having to change code. Illustrator gave me
        the power to design various visual elements from mockups to the logo
        itself. Each page of the project was extensively designed to match a
        given color scheme specificed by Nihkil. Every page was well documented
        in addition to the design to describe how the platform was to be built
        to accompany the design.
